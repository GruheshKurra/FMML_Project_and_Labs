There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "\n",
        "**Answer** : When we increase the percentage of the validation set, we have more data to check how well our model is performing, but less data to train the model. For example, if we go from 20% to 50% validation data, our training data drops from 80% to 50%. This can make the model less accurate because it has less data to learn from. The model might not capture all the patterns in the data, leading to lower accuracy on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if we reduce the validation set percentage, we have more training data. For example, going from 20% to 10% validation data means our training data increases from 80% to 90%. This can make the model learn better and perform better on the validation set because it has more data to understand the patterns. However, too small a validation set might not give us a reliable measure of accuracy since it represents a smaller portion of the data.\n",

        "*   **Small Validation Set**: If the validation set is too small, say 5% or less, the accuracy we get from it might not be reliable. For example, using just 5% of the data for validation might show higher or lower accuracy by chance, not because the model is good or bad.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "Yes, averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits generally gives more consistent results. This approach reduces the impact of any single split that might have had particularly good or bad performance due to random chance. By averaging over multiple splits, the variance in the accuracy estimates is reduced, leading to a more stable and reliable measure of the model’s performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Does it give more accurate estimate of test accuracy?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "Yes, averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits tends to provide a more accurate estimate of test accuracy. Since it takes into account multiple subsets of data, it better represents the performance of the model on unseen data. This method helps mitigate the bias that could be introduced by any single split and gives a more realistic picture of how the model is likely to perform on the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is the effect of the number of iterations on the estimate? Do we get a better estimate with higher iterations?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "Increasing the number of iterations typically improves the accuracy estimate. With more iterations, the model’s performance is averaged over a greater number of splits, which helps smooth out anomalies and provides a more robust measure of the model’s true performance. Essentially, higher iterations lead to a better and more reliable estimate of accuracy, as the effect of any single outlier split diminishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Consider the results you got for the previous questions. Can we deal with a very small train dataset or validation dataset by increasing the iterations?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "Increasing the number of iterations can help when dealing with a very small train or validation dataset, but it has its limits. More iterations can provide a better estimate by leveraging different parts of the data multiple times, which helps in understanding the model’s performance more comprehensively. However, if the dataset is too small, the model might still struggle to learn effectively due to insufficient training data. Thus, while increasing iterations is beneficial, ensuring a minimum threshold of data is also crucial for the model to perform adequately."

        "\n",
        "The accuracy of the 3-nearest neighbor (3NN) classifier changes with the number of splits. Specifically, the accuracy of the 3NN classifier increases slightly with the number of splits. For instance, with a split size of 0.6, the accuracy improves from 33.62% with 5 splits to 33.97% with 15 splits. This indicates that more splits generally lead to a more consistent and reliable measure of accuracy, as the effect of random variations in the splits is reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the accuracy is also affected by the split size. Increasing the split size (i.e., using more data for training) generally improves the accuracy for both 1NN and 3NN classifiers. For example, for 3NN with 10 splits, the accuracy increases from 33.67% with a split size of 0.6 to 34.89% with a split size of 0.8. This suggests that having more training data helps the model learn better and perform more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "In comparison between 1NN and 3NN, the 3NN classifier generally performs slightly better than the 1NN classifier. For instance, with a split size of 0.8 and 10 splits, the 3NN achieves an accuracy of 34.89%, compared to 34.05% for the 1NN. This indicates that considering more neighbors helps in making more robust predictions by reducing the impact of outliers and noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits does provide more consistent results. This is evident from the slight improvements in accuracy as the number of splits increases.\n",
        "- A larger split size (more training data) generally leads to better accuracy. This is seen with both the 1NN and 3NN classifiers, where the accuracy improves as the training set size increases.\n",
        "- The 3NN classifier performs slightly better than the 1NN classifier, suggesting it may be more robust in handling noise and outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, increasing the number of splits and the split size positively impacts the accuracy of both 1NN and 3NN classifiers, with 3NN showing a slight advantage overall. This experiment helps understand the impact of these parameters on the performance of k-nearest neighbor classifiers."
